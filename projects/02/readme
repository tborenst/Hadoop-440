Hi staff, before you continue reading this:
- in order to compile the project simply run make
- in order to run our examples, simply run the runExamples.sh bash script

All other information about using our RMI system can be found in the "How to Use" section of our report, and of course in our examples.

Kesden, thanks for staying up late in gates during the weekend to help us out with this assignment, we appreciate it!

Tomer & Vansi
