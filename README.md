Hadoop 440
====

This repo contains a few student projects for the course 15-440 "Distributed Systems" at Carnegie Mellon. The Hadoop-project contains our version of Hadoop - redesigned and reimplemented from the ground up (without HDFS, using Carneige Mellon's Andrew File System instead).

Most projects also contain SocketIO-related classes, which is my implementation of socket.io (http://socket.io) in Java (while socket.io is for Node.js).
